    <p>I currently work in the IT world as a specialist in physician-facing software and applications.</p>
    <p>My key roles include ensuring that applications are functionaing properly, coordinating with vendors to resolve integration issues,
    <br>developing strategies for product implementation, maintaining professional relationships with the physicians and their staff, and
    <br>ensuring that the physicians are aware of and able to navigate the suite of technology offered by our company.

    <p>I have an amazing wife who showers me in support, and I would not be where I am without her.
    <br>We have 6 fur babies: Millie, Willow, Spencer Peanut, Ezra, and Ollie. 4 dogs and 2 cats.
    <br>They are all wild animals, and we love them.

    <p>I was inspired to start learning HTML by my dear friend, Luke. I hope to turn this into a new hobby as well as a new line on my resume (at some point).
    <br>As I dive further into the coding world, I will be returning here to try out what I've learned. Thanks for coming to my TED talk. Come again.
